# corona-bot
This is a Telegram Bot which responds with the number of Covid19 cases of a given Country. If you're interested in German states you can ask for these as well.

You can just type int "Germany" or "united-states" or even "Bayern"(which is a state in germany) if youre interested in that.

I used the Telegram API of rubenlagus, which can be found here: https://github.com/rubenlagus/TelegramBots

My numbers come from:
